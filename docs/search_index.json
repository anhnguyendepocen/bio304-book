ACT scores are approximately normal with a mean of 20.9 and a standard deviation of 5.6. A college admissions officer wants to determine which of the two applicants scored better on their standardized test with respect to the other test takers: Malaika, who earned an 1350 on her SAT, or Jim, who scored a 28 on his ACT? A: Since the scores are measured on different scales we can not directly compare them, however we can measure the difference of each score in terms of units of standard deviation 18.4.1 Standardized or Z-scores Differences from the mean, measured in units of standard deviation are called “standardized scores” or “Z-scores” The Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above or below the mean. \\[ Z_i = \\frac{x_i - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\] For our SAT/ACT example above: \\[ \\begin{align} Z_\\text{Malaika} &amp;= \\frac{1350 - 1060}{195} = 1.49\\\\ \\\\ Z_\\text{Jim} &amp;= \\frac{28 - 20.9}{5.6} = 1.27\\\\ \\end{align} \\] In this case, Malaika’s score is 1.49 standard deviation above the mean, while Jim’s is 1.27. Based on this, Malaika scored better than Jim. 18.5 Standard normal distribution If \\(X \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\) then the standardized distribution, \\(Z_X \\sim N(0,1)\\). If \\(X\\) is normally distributed, then the Z-scores based on \\(X\\) have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. \\(N(0,1)\\) is known as the standard normal distribution 18.6 Percentiles The percentile is the percentage of observations that fall below a given point, \\(q\\) In R, for a normal distribution the fraction of observations below a given point (the probability that a random observation drawn from the distribution is less than the given value) can be calculatedusing the pnorm(q, mu, sigma) function: # Malaika&#39;s z-score was 1.49. What percentile was she in? pnorm(1.49) ## [1] 0.9318879 Therefore, Malaika is approximately at the 93-percentile. Note that we didn’t have to include the mean and standard deviation in the call to pnorm because we’re dealing with standardized scores, and the defaults for pnorm are mean = 0 and sd = 1. A similar calculation would show that Jim’s percentile is 89.7957685. 18.7 Cutoff points When we use the pnorm() function we give it a given point, \\(q\\), and it gives us the corresponding fraction of values, \\(p\\), that fall below that point in a normal distibution If instead we want to specify a fraction \\(p\\), and get the corresponding point, \\(q\\), on the normal distribution, we use the qnorm(p, mu, sigma) function. # To get the 75-th percentile (3rd quartile) of SAT scores # based on the parameters provided previously qnorm(0.75, 1060, 195) ## [1] 1191.526 18.8 88-95-99.7 Rule If data are approximately normally distributed: ~68% of observations lie within 1 SD of the mean ~95% of observations lie within 2 SD of the mean ~99.7% of observations lie within 3 SD of the mean "]
