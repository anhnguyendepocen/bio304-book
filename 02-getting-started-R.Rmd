# Getting Started with R

## What is R?

R is a statistical computing environment and programming language.  It is free, open source, and has a large and active community of developers and users.  There are many different R packages (libraries) available for conducting a wide variety of different analyses, for everything from genome sequence data to geospatial information.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/) is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a nicer graphical interface to R than does the default R GUI.

The figure below illustrates the RStudio interface, in its default configuration.  For the exercises in this chapter you'll be primarily entering commands in the "console" window. We'll review key parts of the RStudio interface in greater detail in class.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "RStudio window with the panes labeled", results="markup"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fig-rstudio-panes-labeled.png")
```

## Entering commands in the console

You can type commands directly in the console. When you hit Return (Enter) on your keyboard the text you typed is evaluated by the R interpreter.  This means that the R program reads your commands, makes sure there are no syntax errors, and then carries out any commands that were specified.  

Try evaluating the following arithmetic commands in the console:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 + 5
10 - 5
10 / 5
10 * 5
```

If you type an incomplete command and then hit Return on your keyboard, the console will show a continuation line marked by a `+` symbol. For example enter the incomplete statement `(10 + 5` and then hit Enter. You should see something like this.  

```
> (10 + 5
+
```

The continuation line tells you that R is waiting for additional input before it evaluates what you typed. Either complete your command (e.g. type the closing parenthesis) and hit Return, or hit the "Esc" key to exit the continuation line without evaluating what you typed.

## Comments

When working in the R console, or writing R code, the pound symbol (`#`) indicates the start of a comment.  Anything after the `#`, up to the end of the current line, is ignored by the R interpretter.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# This line will be ignored
5 + 4 # the first part of this line, up to the #, will be evaluated
2 # * 3  + 4 * 5
```

Throughout this course I will often include short explanatory comments in the code examples.

## Using R as a Calculator

The simplest way to use R is as a fancy calculator.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 + 2 # addition
10 - 2 # subtraction
10 * 2 # multiplication
10 / 2 # division
10 ^ 2 # exponentiation
10 ** 2 # alternate exponentiation
pi * 2.5^2 # R knows about some constants such as Pi
10 %% 3 # modulus operator -- gives remainder after division
10 %/% 3 # integer division
```

Be aware that certain operators have precedence over others. For example multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Use parentheses to disambiguate potentially confusing statements.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
(10 + 2)/4-5   # was the output what you expected?
(10 + 2)/(4-5) # compare the answer to the above
```

Division by zero produces an object that represents infinite numbers. Infinite values can be either positive or negative

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
1/0  # Inf
-1/0 # -Inf
```

Invalid calculations produce a objected called `NaN` which is short for "Not a Number":

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
0/0  # invalid calculation
```

### Common mathematical functions

Many commonly used mathematical functions are built into R. Here are some examples:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
abs(-3)   # absolute value
abs(3)
cos(pi/3) # cosine
sin(pi/3) # sine
log(10)   # natural logarithm
log10(10) # log base 10
log2(10) # log base 2
exp(1)    # exponential function
sqrt(10)  # square root
10 ^ 0.5  # same as square root
```





## The R Help System

R comes with fairly extensive documentation and a simple help system. You can access HTML versions of the R documentation under the Help tab in Rstudio.  The HTML documentation also includes information on any packages you've installed. Take a few minutes to browse through the R HTML documentation. In addition to the HTML documentation there is also a search box where you can enter a term to search on (see red arrow in figure below).


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "The RStudio Help tab", results="markup"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fig-rstudio-help.png")
```


### Getting help from the console

In addition to getting help from the RStudio help tab, you can directly search for help from the console. The help system can be invoked using the `help` function or the `?` operator.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
help("log")
?log
```

If you are using RStudio, the help results will appear in the "Help" tab of the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer  (lower right window by default).

What if you don't know the name of the function you want? You can use the `help.search()` function.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
help.search("log")
```

In this case `help.search("log")` returns all the functions with
the string `log` in them. For more on `help.search` type
`?help.search`. 

Other useful help related functions include `apropos()` and `example()`.  `apropos` returns a list of all objects (including function names) in the current session that match the input string.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
apropos("log")
```

`example()` provides  examples of how a function is used.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example(log)
```




## Variable assignment in R

An important concept in all programming languages is that of "variable assignment".  Variable assignment is the act of creating labels that point to particular data values in a computers memory, which allows us to apply operations to the labels rather than directly to specific values.  Variable assignment is an important mechanism of abstracting and generalizing computational operations.

Variable assignment in R is accomplished with the assignment operator, which is designated as `<-` (left arrow, constructed from a left angular bracket and the minus sign). This is illustrated below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- 10  # assign the variable name 'x' the value 10
sin(x)   # apply the sin function to the value x points to
x <- pi  # x now points to a different value
sin(x)   # the same function call now produces a different result 
```

### Valid variable names

As described in the [R documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html), "A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as '.2way' are not valid, and neither are the [reserved words](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)." 

Here are some examples of valid and invalid variable names. Mentally evaluate these based on the definition above, and then evaluate these in the R interpetter to confirm your understanding :

```
x <- 10
x.prime <- 10
x_prime <- 10
my.long.variable.name <- 10
another_long_variable_name <- 10
_x <- 10
.x <- 10
2.x <- 2 * x
```


## Data types

All of our arithmetic examples above produced numerical values. The default numerical data type in R is called a "double".  "double" is short for "double precision floating point value" which refers to the numerical precision that R uses when carrying out calculations.

R has a function called  `typeof()` that we can use to get information about an object's type.  Let's illustrate the use of `typeof()` and confirm that our numerical calculations return objects of the "double" type:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
typeof(10)
x <- 10.5
typeof(x)
```

## Logical values

When we compare values to each other, our calculations no longer return "doubles" but rather `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. This is illustrated below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 < 9  # is 10 less than 9?
10 > 9  # is 10 greater than 9?
10 <= (5 * 2) # less than or equal to?
10 >= pi # greater than or equal to?
10 == 10 # equals?
10 != 10 # does not equal?
```

`TRUE` and `FALSE` objects are of "logical" data type (known as "Booleans" in many other languages, after the mathematician George Boole).   

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(FALSE)
x <- FALSE
typeof(x)
```

When working with numerical data, tests of equality can be tricky.  For example, consider the following two comparisons:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 == (sqrt(10)^2) # Surprised by the result? See below.
4 == (sqrt(4)^2) # Even more confused?
```

Mathematically we know that both $(\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$ and $(\sqrt{4})^2 = 4$ are true statements. Why does R tell us the first statement is false? What we're running into here are the limits of computer precision. A computer can't represent $\sqrt 10$ exactly, whereas $\sqrt 4$ can be exactly represented.
Precision in numerical computing is a complex subject and a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this course.  However, it's important to be aware of this limitation (this limitation is true of any programming language, not just R).  

To test "near equality" R provides a function called `all.equal()`.  This function takes two inputs -- the numerical values to be compared -- and returns True if their values are equal up to a certain level of tolerance (defined by the built-in numerical precision of your computer).

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all.equal(10, sqrt(10)^2)
```

### Logical operators

Logical values support Boolean operations, like logical negation ("not"), "and", "or", "xor", etc. This is illustrated below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
!x  # logical negation -- reads as "not x"
x & y # AND: are x and y both TRUE?
x | y # OR: are either x or y TRUE?
xor(x,y)  # XOR: is either x or y TRUE, but not both?
```

The function `isTRUE` is sometimes useful:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- 10
z <- x > y
isTRUE(z)
```


## Character strings

Character strings ("character") represent single textual characters or a longer sequence of characters.  They are created by enclosing the characters in text either single our double quotes.

```{r}
typeof("abc")  # double quotes 
typeof('abc')  # single quotes
```

Character strings have a length, which can be found using the `nchar` function:

```{r}
first.name <- "jasmine"
nchar(first.name)

last.name <- 'smith'
nchar(last.name)
```

There are a number of built-in functions for manipulating character strings. Here are some of the most common ones.

### Joining strings

The `paste()` function joins two characters strings together:
```{r}
paste(first.name, last.name)  # join two strings
paste("abc", "def")
```

Notice that `paste()` adds a space between the strings?  If we didn't want the space we can call the `paste()` function with an optional argument called `sep` (short for separator) which specifies the character(s) that are inserted between the joined strings.

```{r}
paste("abc", "def", sep = "")  # join with no space; "" is an empty string
paste("abc", "def", sep = "|") # join with a vertical bar
```

### Splitting strings

The `strsplit()` function allows us to split a character string into substrains according to matches to a substring.  For example, we could break a sentence into it's constituent words as follows:

```{r}
sentence <- "Call me Ishmael."
words <- strsplit(sentence, " ")  # split on space
words
```

Notice that `strsplit()` is the reverse of `paste()`.

### Substrings

The `substr()` function allows us to extract a substring from a character object by specifying the first and last positions (indices) to use in the extraction:

```{r}
substr("abcdef", 2, 5)  # get substring from characters 2 to 5
substr(first.name, 1, 3) # get substring from characters 1 to       
```

## Packages {#packages}
  
Packages are libraries of R functions and data that provide additional capabilities and tools beyond the standard library of functions included with R.  Hundreds of people around the world have developed packages for R that provide functions and related data structures  for conducting many different types of analyses.

Throughout this course you'll need to install a variety of packages. Here I show the basic procedure for installing new packages from the console as well as from the R Studio interface.

### Installing packages from the console

The built-in function `install.packages` provides a quick and conveniet way to install packages from the R console.  

### Install the tidyverse package

To illustrate the use of `install.package`, we'll install a collection of packages (a "meta-package") called the [tidyverse](http://www.tidyverse.org).  Here's how to install the tidyverse meta-package from the R console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse", dependencies = TRUE)
```

The first argument to `install.packages` gives the names of the package we want to install. The second argument, `dependencies = TRUE`, tells R to install any additional packages that tidyverse depends on.


### Installing packages from the RStudio dialog

You can also install packages using a graphical dialog provided by RStudio. To do so pick the `Packages` tab in RStudio, and then click the `Install` button.  

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "The Packages tab in RStudio", results="markup"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fig-rstudio-packages-tab.png")
```

In the packages entry box you can type the name of the package you wish to install. 



### Loading packages with the `library()` function

Once a package is installed on your computer, the package can be loaded into your R session using the `library` function.  To insure our previous install commands worked correctly, let's load the packages we just installed.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Since the tidyverse pacakge is a "meta-package" it provides some additional info about the sub-packages that got loaded.  

When you load tidyverse, you will also see a message about "Conflicts" as several of the functions provided in the dplyr package (a sub-package in tidyverse) conflict with names of functions provided by the "stats" package which usually gets automically loaded when you start R.  The conflicting funcdtions are `filter` and `lag`. The conflicting functions in the stats package are `lag` and `filter` which are used in time series analysis.  The `dplyr` functions are  more generally useful. Furthermore, if you need these masked functions you can still access them by prefacing the function name with the name of the package (e.g. `stats::filter`).


## Reading data from a file

We'll use the `read_csv` function defined in the `readr` package (loaded via `tidyverse`) to read a CSV formatted data file.  We'll load a data file called `possums.csv`.

```{r, message=FALSE}
possums <- read_csv("https://tinyurl.com/bio304-possums-csv")
```

The possums data set includes information from a study of mountain brushtail possums (*Trichosurus caninus*; Lindenmayer DB et al. 1995, Australian Journal of Zoology 43, 449-458.)  The investigators recorded variables about individual possum's sex, age, where they were collected, and a range of morphological measurements. For example the variable `skullw` is the width of the skull, `taill` is tail length, etc.  

Notice that we read the CSV file directly from a remote file via a URL.  If instead, you wanted to load a local file on your computer you would specify the "path" -- i.e. the location on your hard drive where you stored the file.  For example, here is how I would load the same file if it was stored in the standard downloads directory on my Mac laptop:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# this assumes you're running a local version of R (i.e. on your laptop)
possums <- read_csv("/Users/pmagwene/Downloads/possums.csv")
```


## Exploring the "possums" data set

Let's take a moment to explore the possums data set.  First, how big is it? The `dim` function will tell us the dimensions (# of rows and columns) of the data table we loaded:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dim(possums)
```

What are the names of the columns of the table?

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
names(possums)
```

## Simple tables

Let's use the `count` function to count the number of male and female possums and the number collected from each of the populations of interest in this study (Victoria and "other"):

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
count(possums, sex)
count(possums, Pop)
```

We can break down the counts by population and sex combinined by specifying both variables:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
count(possums, Pop, sex)
```
How do the results differ if  instead you write `count(possums, sex, Pop)`?

Finally, let's get counts for the different age groups in the study:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
count(possums, age)
```

Notice that besides the nine age groups, there is a grouping for "NA". "NA" means "not available" and is the standard designation for missing values.  This table tells us there are two possums for which age estimates were not available.


## Simple figures

Throughout this course we'll use a package called "ggplot2" to generate figures.  The ggplot2 package is part of the tidyverse and is automatically loaded when we load the tidyverse library.  In the code below, we'll demonstrate how to use ggplot by example.  In a later lecture we'll go into greater detail about how ggplot is structured and the broader conceptual framework that underpins its design.

## Bar plots

First let's create some simple bar plots as alternate representations of the counts:

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + geom_bar(aes(x = sex))
```

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + geom_bar(aes(x = Pop))
```

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + geom_bar(aes(x = Pop, fill = sex))
```


## Histograms

A histogram is a special type of bar plot, typically used with continuous data.  In a histogram, we divide the range of the data into bins of a given size, and use vertical bars to depict the frequency (count) of observations that fall into each bin.  This gives a good sense of the intervals in which most of the observations are found.

Here is a histogram for the skull width data:

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + geom_histogram(aes(x = skullw))
```

Notice the warning message that was generated, about the default number of bins that were used.  ggplot is alerting us that that we may want to consider regenerating the plot with a different number of bins.  Let's try a smaller number of bins:

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + geom_histogram(aes(x = skullw), bins = 20)
```

Try creating histograms for `taill` and `totlngth`.

## Scatter plots

A scatter plot is typically used to represent two numerical variables simultaneously. Each point in a scatter plot is an individual in the data set, and the location of the points represent the measured values of the variables of interest on that individual.

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + geom_point(aes(x = totlngth, y = taill))
```

We can add information about categorical variables to our scatter plot by using color or shape to depict different classes


```{r}
ggplot(possums) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = totlngth, y = taill, color = Pop))
```


We can represent more than two categorical variables in our scatter plot by using both shape and color.  We'll also change the size and transparency of the plotted points (via the `alpha` argument).

```{r}
ggplot(possums) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = totlngth, y = taill, color = Pop, shape = sex),
             size = 2, alpha = 0.75)
```

Explore some of the other bivariate relationships in the possums data by creating additional scatter plots.  Given 9 numerical variables, how many distinct pairwise scatter plots could you create?
