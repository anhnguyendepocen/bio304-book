# Getting Started with R

## What is R?

R is a statistical computing environment and programming language.  It is free, open source, and has a large and active community of developers and users.  There are many different R packages (libraries) available for conducting a wide variety of different analyses, for everything from genome sequence data to geospatial information.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/) is an open source integrated development environment (IDE) that provides a nicer graphical interface to R than does the default R GUI.

The figure below illustrates the RStudio interface, in its default configuration.  For the exercises in this chapter you'll be primarily entering commands in the "console" window. We'll review key parts of the RStudio interface in greater detail in class.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "RStudio window with the panes labeled", results="markup"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fig-rstudio-panes-labeled.png")
```

## Entering commands in the console

You can type commands directly in the console. When you hit Return (Enter) on your keyboard the text you typed is evaluated by the R interpreter.  This means that the R program reads your commands, makes sure there are no syntax errors, and then carries out any commands that were specified.  

Try evaluating the following arithmetic commands in the console:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 + 5
10 - 5
10 / 5
10 * 5
```

If you type an incomplete command and then hit Return on your keyboard, the console will show a continuation line marked by a `+` symbol. For example enter the incomplete statement `(10 + 5` and then hit Enter. You should see something like this.  

```
> (10 + 5
+
```

The continuation line tells you that R is waiting for additional input before it evaluates what you typed. Either complete your command (e.g. type the closing parenthesis) and hit Return, or hit the "Esc" key to exit the continuation line without evaluating what you typed.

## Comments

When working in the R console, or writing R code, the pound symbol (`#`) indicates the start of a comment.  Anything after the `#`, up to the end of the current line, is ignored by the R interpretter.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
# This line will be ignored
5 + 4 # the first part of this line, up to the #, will be evaluated
2 # * 3  + 4 * 5
```

Throughout this course I will often include short explanatory comments in the code examples.

## Using R as a Calculator

The simplest way to use R is as a fancy calculator.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 + 2 # addition
10 - 2 # subtraction
10 * 2 # multiplication
10 / 2 # division
10 ^ 2 # exponentiation
10 ** 2 # alternate exponentiation
pi * 2.5^2 # R knows about some constants such as Pi
10 %% 3 # modulus operator -- gives remainder after division
10 %/% 3 # integer division
```

Be aware that certain operators have precedence over others. For example multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. Use parentheses to disambiguate potentially confusing statements.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
(10 + 2)/4-5   # was the output what you expected?
(10 + 2)/(4-5) # compare the answer to the above
```

Division by zero produces an object that represents infinite numbers. Infinite values can be either positive or negative

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
1/0  # Inf
-1/0 # -Inf
```

Invalid calculations produce a objected called `NaN` which is short for "Not a Number":

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
0/0  # invalid calculation
```

### Common mathematical functions

Many commonly used mathematical functions are built into R. Here are some examples:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
abs(-3)   # absolute value
abs(3)
cos(pi/3) # cosine
sin(pi/3) # sine
log(10)   # natural logarithm
log10(10) # log base 10
log2(10) # log base 2
exp(1)    # exponential function
sqrt(10)  # square root
10 ^ 0.5  # same as square root
```


## The R Help System

R comes with fairly extensive documentation and a simple help system. You can access HTML versions of the R documentation under the Help tab in Rstudio.  The HTML documentation also includes information on any packages you've installed. Take a few minutes to browse through the R HTML documentation. In addition to the HTML documentation there is also a search box where you can enter a term to search on (see red arrow in figure below).


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "600px", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "The RStudio Help tab", results="markup"}
knitr::include_graphics("./figures/fig-rstudio-help.png")
```


### Getting help from the console

In addition to getting help from the RStudio help tab, you can directly search for help from the console. The help system can be invoked using the `help` function or the `?` operator.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
help("log")
?log
```

If you are using RStudio, the help results will appear in the "Help" tab of the Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer  (lower right window by default).

What if you don't know the name of the function you want? You can use the `help.search()` function.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
help.search("log")
```

In this case `help.search("log")` returns all the functions with
the string `log` in them. For more on `help.search` type
`?help.search`. 

Other useful help related functions include `apropos()` and `example()`.  `apropos` returns a list of all objects (including function names) in the current session that match the input string.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
apropos("log")
```

`example()` provides  examples of how a function is used.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
example(log)
```




## Variable assignment in R

An important concept in all programming languages is that of "variable assignment".  Variable assignment is the act of creating labels that point to particular data values in a computers memory, which allows us to apply operations to the labels rather than directly to specific values.  Variable assignment is an important mechanism of abstracting and generalizing computational operations.

Variable assignment in R is accomplished with the assignment operator, which is designated as `<-` (left arrow, constructed from a left angular bracket and the minus sign). This is illustrated below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- 10  # assign the variable name 'x' the value 10
sin(x)   # apply the sin function to the value x points to
x <- pi  # x now points to a different value
sin(x)   # the same function call now produces a different result 
```

### Valid variable names

As described in the [R documentation](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/make.names.html), "A syntactically valid name consists of letters, numbers and the dot or underline characters and starts with a letter or the dot not followed by a number. Names such as '.2way' are not valid, and neither are the [reserved words](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Reserved.html)." 

Here are some examples of valid and invalid variable names. Mentally evaluate these based on the definition above, and then evaluate these in the R interpetter to confirm your understanding :

```
x <- 10
x.prime <- 10
x_prime <- 10
my.long.variable.name <- 10
another_long_variable_name <- 10
_x <- 10
.x <- 10
2.x <- 2 * x
```


## Data types

All of our arithmetic examples above produced numerical values. The default numerical data type in R is called a "double".  "double" is short for "double precision floating point value" which refers to the numerical precision that R uses when carrying out calculations.

R has a function called  `typeof()` that we can use to get information about an object's type.  Let's illustrate the use of `typeof()` and confirm that our numerical calculations return objects of the "double" type:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
typeof(10)
x <- 10.5
typeof(x)
```

## Logical values

When we compare values to each other, our calculations no longer return "doubles" but rather `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. This is illustrated below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 < 9  # is 10 less than 9?
10 > 9  # is 10 greater than 9?
10 <= (5 * 2) # less than or equal to?
10 >= pi # greater than or equal to?
10 == 10 # equals?
10 != 10 # does not equal?
```

`TRUE` and `FALSE` objects are of "logical" data type (known as "Booleans" in many other languages, after the mathematician George Boole).   

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
typeof(TRUE)
typeof(FALSE)
x <- FALSE
typeof(x)
```

When working with numerical data, tests of equality can be tricky.  For example, consider the following two comparisons:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
10 == (sqrt(10)^2) # Surprised by the result? See below.
4 == (sqrt(4)^2) # Even more confused?
```

Mathematically we know that both $(\sqrt{10})^2 = 10$ and $(\sqrt{4})^2 = 4$ are true statements. Why does R tell us the first statement is false? What we're running into here are the limits of computer precision. A computer can't represent $\sqrt 10$ exactly, whereas $\sqrt 4$ can be exactly represented.
Precision in numerical computing is a complex subject and a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this course.  However, it's important to be aware of this limitation (this limitation is true of any programming language, not just R).  

To test "near equality" R provides a function called `all.equal()`.  This function takes two inputs -- the numerical values to be compared -- and returns True if their values are equal up to a certain level of tolerance (defined by the built-in numerical precision of your computer).

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
all.equal(10, sqrt(10)^2)
```

### Logical operators

Logical values support Boolean operations, like logical negation ("not"), "and", "or", "xor", etc. This is illustrated below:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- TRUE
y <- FALSE
!x  # logical negation -- reads as "not x"
x & y # AND: are x and y both TRUE?
x | y # OR: are either x or y TRUE?
xor(x,y)  # XOR: is either x or y TRUE, but not both?
```

The function `isTRUE` is sometimes useful:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
x <- 5
y <- 10
z <- x > y
isTRUE(z)
```


## Character strings

Character strings ("character") represent single textual characters or a longer sequence of characters.  They are created by enclosing the characters in text either single our double quotes.

```{r}
typeof("abc")  # double quotes 
typeof('abc')  # single quotes
```

Character strings have a length, which can be found using the `nchar` function:

```{r}
first.name <- "jasmine"
nchar(first.name)

last.name <- 'smith'
nchar(last.name)
```

There are a number of built-in functions for manipulating character strings. Here are some of the most common ones.

### Joining strings

The `paste()` function joins two characters strings together:
```{r}
paste(first.name, last.name)  # join two strings
paste("abc", "def")
```

Notice that `paste()` adds a space between the strings?  If we didn't want the space we can call the `paste()` function with an optional argument called `sep` (short for separator) which specifies the character(s) that are inserted between the joined strings.

```{r}
paste("abc", "def", sep = "")  # join with no space; "" is an empty string
paste("abc", "def", sep = "|") # join with a vertical bar
```

### Splitting strings

The `strsplit()` function allows us to split a character string into substrains according to matches to a substring.  For example, we could break a sentence into it's constituent words as follows:

```{r}
sentence <- "Call me Ishmael."
words <- strsplit(sentence, " ")  # split on space
words
```

Notice that `strsplit()` is the reverse of `paste()`.

### Substrings

The `substr()` function allows us to extract a substring from a character object by specifying the first and last positions (indices) to use in the extraction:

```{r}
substr("abcdef", 2, 5)  # get substring from characters 2 to 5
substr(first.name, 1, 3) # get substring from characters 1 to       
```


## Vectors are the simplest data structure in R

In computer science, the term "data structure" refers to the ways that data are stored, retrieved, and organized in a computer's memory.  Common examples include lists, hash tables (also called dictionaries), sets, queues, and trees. Different types of data structures are used to support different types of operations on data.

Vectors are the core data structure in R. Vectors store an ordered lists of items, *all of the same type* (i.e. the data in a vector are "homogenous" with respect to their type).

### Creating vectors

The simplest way to create a vector at the interactive prompt is to use the `c()` function, which is short hand for "combine" or "concatenate".

```{r}
x <- c(2,4,6,8)  # create a vector, assign it the variable name `x`
x
```

Vectors in R always have a type (accessed with the `typeof()` function) and a length (accessed with the `length()` function).

```{r}
length(x)
typeof(x)
```


Vectors don't have to be numerical; logical and character vectors work just as well.

```{r}
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
y
typeof(y)
length(y)

z <- c("How", "now", "brown", "cow")
z
typeof(z)
length(z)
```

You can also use `c()` to concatenate two or more vectors together.

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
y <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)  # create another vector, labeled y
xy <- c(x,y)  # combine two vectors
xy

z <- c(pi/4, pi/2, pi, 2*pi)
xyz <- c(x, y, z)  # combine three vectors
xyz
```

### Vectors from regular sequences

There are a variety of functions for creating regular sequences in the form of vectors.

```{r}
1:10  # create a vector with the integer values from 1 to 10
20:11  # a vector with the integer values from 20 to 11

seq(1, 10)  # like 1:10
seq(1, 10, by = 2) # 1:10, in steps of 2
seq(2, 4, by = 0.25) # 2 to 4, in steps of 0.25

# create a vector of length 25 with values between 1 and 10
seq(1, 10, length.out = 25) 
```


### Vector arithmetic

The basic R arithmetic operations work on numeric vectors as well as on single numbers (in fact, behind the scenes in R single numbers *are* vectors!).

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
x * 2  # multiply each element of x by 2
x - pi # subtract pi from each element of x

y <- c(0, 1, 3, 5, 9)
x + y  # add together each matching element of x and y
x * y # multiply each matching element of x and y
x/y # divide each matching element of x and y
```


### Vector recycling

In operations that involve pairs of vectors, when vectors are not of the same length R `recycles' the elements of the shorter vector to make the lengths conform. 

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
length(x)
z <- c(1, 4, 7, 11)
length(z)
x + z
```

In the example above `z` was treated as if it was the vector `(1, 4, 7, 11, 1)`.

### Numerical functions for numerical vectors

Basic numerical functions operate element-wise on numerical vectors. Here are a few examples.

```{r}
sin(x)
cos(x * pi)
log(x)
sum(x)
min(x)
max(x)
```


### Indexing Vectors

Accessing the element of a vector is called "indexing".  Indexing is the process of specifying the numerical positions (indices) that you want to take access from the vector.

For a vector of length $n$, we can access the elements by the indices $1 \ldots n$. We say that R vectors (and other data structures like lists) are `one-indexed'. Many other programming languages, such as Python, C, and Java, use zero-indexing where the elements of a data structure are accessed by the indices $0 \ldots n-1$. Indexing errors are a common source of bugs. 

Indexing a vector is done by specifying the index in square brackets as shown below:

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
length(x)

x[1]  # return the 1st element of x

x[4]  # return the 4th element of x
```

Negative indices are used to exclude particular elements. `x[-1]` returns all elements of `x` except the first. 

```{r}
x[-1]
```

You can get multiple elements of a vector by indexing by another vector. In the example below, `x[c(3,5)]` returns the third and fifth element of x`.

```{r}
x[c(3,5)]
```

### Comparison operators applied to vectors

When the comparison operators, such as"greater than" (`>`), "less than or equal to" (`<=`), equality (`==`), etc. are applied to  numeric vectors, they return logical vectors:

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
x < 8  # returns TRUE for all elements lass than 8
```

Here's a fancier example:

```{r}
x > 4 & x < 10  # greater than 4 AND less than 10
```



### Combining Indexing and Comparison of Vectors

A very powerful feature of R is the ability to combine the comparison operators (which return TRUE or FALSE values) with indexing. This facilitates data filtering and subsetting. 

Here's an example:
```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10) 
x[x > 5]
```

In the first example we retrieved all the elements of `x` that are larger than 5 (read as "x where x is greater than 5"). Notice how we got back all the elements where the statement in the brackets was `TRUE`.

You can string together comparisons for more complex filtering.

```{r}
x[x < 4 | x > 8]  # less than four OR greater than 8
```

In the second example we retrieved those elements of `x` that were smaller than four  *or* greater than six. Combining indexing and comparison is a powerful concept which we'll use repeatedly in this course.


### Vector manipulation

You can combine indexing with assignment to change the elements of a vectors:

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
x[2] <- -4 
x
```

You can also use indexing vectors to change multiple values at once:

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
x[c(1, 3, 5)]  <- 6
x
```

Using logical vectors to manipulate the elements of a vector also works:

```{r}
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
x[x > 5] = 5    # truncate all values to have max value 5
x
```


### Additional functions for working with vectors

The function `unique()` returns the unique items in a vector:

```{r}
x <- c(5, 2, 1, 4, 6, 9, 8, 5, 7, 9)
unique(x)
```

`rev()` returns the items in reverse order (without changing the input vector):

```{r}
y <- rev(x)
y
x  # x is still in original order
```

There are a number of useful functions related to sorting. Plain `sort()` returns a new vector with the items in sorted order:

```{r}
sorted.x <- sort(x)  # returns items of x sorted
sorted.x
x        # but x remains in its unsorted state
```

The related function `order()` gives the indices which would rearrange the items into sorted order:

```{r}
order(x)
```

`order()` can be useful when you want to sort one list by the values of another:

```{r}
students <- c("fred", "tabitha", "beatriz", "jose")
class.ranking <- c(4, 2, 1, 3)

students[order(class.ranking)]  # get the students sorted by their class.ranking
```

`any()` and `all()`, return single boolean values based on a specified comparison provided as an argument:

```{r}
y <- c(2, 4, 5, 6, 8)

any(y > 5) # returns TRUE if any of the elements are TRUE

all(y > 5) # returns TRUE if all of the elements are TRUE
```

`which()` returns the *indices* of the vector for which the input is true:
```{r}
which(y > 5)
```
