### The `stringr` package

The [`stringr`](http://stringr.tidyverse.org) package provides a variety of useful functions for working with character strings. Install the `stringr` package using one of the package installation mechanisms we discussed in the previous chapter. Once `stringr` is installed you can load it as follows:

```{r}
library(stringr) 
```

 All of the functions in the `stringr` package are prefixed with `str_`.  Here are some examples:

```{r}
darwin.quote <- "There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one..."

str_length(darwin.quote)  # equivalent to nchar

# how many times does the character "s" appear in the string?
str_count(darwin.quote, "s")

# duplicate a string
str_dup("hello", 3)

# other interesting functions
str_to_title("on the origin of species")
str_to_upper("loud and bombastic")
```
